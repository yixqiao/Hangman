# Hangman
Computer plays hangman by a pretty simple algorithm.

## Quickstart
1. Clone repository
2. Run `./gradle build`
3. Run `./gradle run --console=plain` (plain console makes stdin neater)
4. Once prompted for `Word:`, enter a word that the computer will try to guess
5. Watch the computer guess the word
